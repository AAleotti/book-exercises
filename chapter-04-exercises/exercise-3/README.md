# Exercise 3
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called `README.md`. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.

In your `README.md` document, provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far. In particular, you should include the following:

- A _heading_ with the name of the command;
- An example of how it can be used (formatted as a code block);
- A _list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used).

Note that you can preview this Markdown in Atom to make sure it works correctly.


## The command that I learnt is _sed_

Example of usage:

`sed -i "s/*/_/g" < file.text`

Information about this command:
- sed can be used to replace a character with another character
- in the example above "*" is going to be replaced with "_"
- sed is going to do this substitution globally
- the change is going to be done directly in the input file
